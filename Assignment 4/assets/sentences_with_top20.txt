[Scene: The Charity Event, they’re holding a silent auction, Rachel is looking at one of the items and Phoebe walks up and hands her a glass of wine.]
======
Rachel: Oh!
======
Phoebe: So now what’s going on here?
======
They lay out all the stuff here and then you write down your offer and then the highest bid gets it.
======
Phoebe: No, I know what a silent is I meant, what’s going on with your hair?
======
It’s nice!

[Scene: Elizabeth’s Dorm Room, Ross is walking up to her door and knocks on it.
======
So I’m just gonna guess since it doesn’t matter one way or the other.
======
(The last part is to discourage e-mails, who cares if I got it right or not?)}
======
Ross: What’s-what’s going on?
======
Elizabeth: The guys across the hall are throwing water balloons at us.
======
Ross: Oh, you have to call the police!
======
Ross: Oh!
======
Listen umm, I, I just stopped by to see if you wanted to see this play tonight.
======
The director is the same…

Elizabeth: (ignoring him and picking up a pitcher) Who drank all the Kamikazes?
======
(Indicates the aforementioned balloons causing both of them to scream in delight and start drinking from the balloons.)
======
Elizabeth: (To Ross) You want some?!
======
Okay!
======
Okay, look, can I, can I just-just talk to you for a second?
======
Elizabeth: Yeah, sure.
======
Ross: Uh, so this play umm, what do you think?
======
It’s-it’s gotten great reviews!
======
Y’know the uh…

(Suddenly the door opens and two guys come rushing in wielding water balloons.)
======
(They start lobbing the balloons in.
======
Ross desperately tries to get out of the line of fire but is struck in the back.
======
The girls all retreat to relative safety behind the couch.)
======
The Girls: You put your balloons down!!
======
First Dorm Guy: You put your balloons down!!

(Shows everyone where he was hit.)

======
Mr. Thompson: And finally, our biggest item of the night, the 22-foot gentleman’s day sailer sailboat.

[Scene: A Restaurant, Monica and Chandler are sitting at a table.
======
Monica: What are you doing?
======
(It’s a butchered version of the Pledge of Allegiance of the United States for our foreign friends.)
======
The champagne is here.
======
(The waiter is delivering it and pouring two glasses.)
======
I’m good!
======
Are you good?
======
Monica: Yeah.
======
Chandler: Oh, yeah.
======
If you thought that you were going to be cold, you should’ve brought your own jacket.
======
In fact I’ve been fine for a long time now and I think, the reason is you.
======
Monica: Ohh that’s sweet!
======
Chandler: Okay umm, before I meant you I had really little life and I couldn’t imagine growing old with…

(As he’s talking Monica notices someone familiar has just entered the restaurant.
======
Let’s see; I seem to remember him driving a Ferrari in Hawaii solving crimes as a private investigator and as a certain eye doctor in more recent times.)
======
Monica: (interrupting him) Oh my God!
======
Chandler: (not knowing the true meaning of her exclamation) I know, but just let me say it.
======
Monica: Oh my God, Richard.
======
Chandler: What?!
======
(She nods towards the doorway, Chandler turns and looks) Oh, that’s Richard!
======
Monica: Oh God, maybe he won’t see us.
======
Chandler: Hey-hey, hey!
======
I don’t know why I did that!
======
Monica: Hey, it’s good to see you!
======
Richard: You too, you let uh, your hair grow long.
======
Monica: Yeah—Oh that’s right.
======
You, you always wanted me too.
======
Hey, I see you got your mustache back.
======
Richard: Well, my nose got lonely.
======
Chandler: (to Richard’s date) And uh, you don’t have a mustache which is good.
======
(She just smiles.)
======
Richard: Oh, I’m sorry.
======
No one supposed to know about us!
======
Chandler: Yeah, I’ll sit down.
======
Monica: (to Richard) It’s good to see you

Matire'd: (to Richard) You’re table’s ready sir.

Commercial Break

[Scene: The Charity Event, Rachel, Phoebe, and Joey are sitting at their table.]
======
Rachel: What were you thinking?!
======
Joey: I didn’t know it was an auction!
======
Joey: I don’t know!
======
Phoebe: Well, just buy the damn boat!
======
(She’s still working her way through her tray of booze.)
======
Rachel: Phoebe, don’t you think you’ve had enough to drink?
======
Mr. Thompson: (approaching) Mr. Tribbiani.
======
Joey: Oh hi!
======
Mr. Thompson: Your generous contribution brings us a big step closer to building the youth center.
======
Mr. Thompson: I think it was valued at 19,000

Joey: (To Rachel) Hey, I was pretty close.
======
(She just glares at him.)
======
Umm, I can’t buy the boat, I don’t have any money.
======
(Mr. Thompson looks shocked and at Rachel, she suddenly starts laughing.)
======
Joey, good one!
======
(Mr. Thompson starts to laugh.)
======
Mr. Thompson: That’s good.
======
Very good!
======
Joey: So uh listen, I think I’m gonna take off now.
======
(Starts to get up.)
======
Rachel: (stopping him) Hey!
======
You…can’t…leave Joey!
======
You agreed to buy that boat, all right?!
======
Joey: Well, what am I gonna do Rach?!
======
I don’t have that kind of money!
======
Rachel: I know.
======
Okay.
======
(Whispering and thinking.)
======
Rachel: Okay.
======
Joey: Look, I don’t know why the kids need a youth center anyway!
======
Y’know?
======
They should just watch TV after school like I did and I turned out fine!
======
[Scene: The Restaurant, Monica and Chandler’s and Richard and Lisa’s tables have been pushed together and they’re all eating and talking.]
======
Monica: So I hide in the shower and the next thing you know they’re going at it right on the bathroom floor.
======
Lisa: (laughing) Oh my God!
======
{Transcriber’s Note: For further reading on the above story, please check out The One Where Joey Moves Out.}
======
Chandler: I got a good one, I got a good one!
======
Richard: It’s so great seeing you guys again.
======
I’d like to make a toast.
======
(Everyone raises their glasses) Uh, as a poet once said, "In the sweetness of friendship, let there be laughter and sharing of pleasures for in the due of little things the heart finds it’s morning and is refreshed."
======
Monica: Ohh.
======
(They all drink.)
======
[Scene: Monica, Chandler, and Phoebe's, Monica and Chandler are returning to find Ross is there waiting for them.]
======
Ross: Oh my God, you guys!!
======
Chandler: (stopping him from going any further) Before you say anything, have we got a story for you!
======
Ross: What?
======
(Realizes) Ohh.
======
Oh that’s right that’s right.
======
Chandler: Oh you knew that.
======
Monica: I thought you were going out with Elizabeth.
======
Ross: Yeah, I was but uh, she was a little busy with a water balloon fight.
======
Monica: Oh Ross, sometimes grown-ups have commitments they just can’t get out of!
======
Ross: Y’know, maybe she is too young for me.
======
Y’know, when I was over there and she was running around with her friends, I felt like I was a baby-sitter.
======
I finally started to see what you guys were talking about.
======
I don’t know what to do.
======
Monica: Why don’t you just weigh out the good stuff about the relationship against the bad stuff.
======
Ross: Okay umm, bad stuff.
======
Well, I’m-I’m 12 years older than she is.
======
Monica: She’s leaving for three months.
======
Ross: Okay, good stuff.
======
Umm, well she’s-she’s sweet and pretty and…

Monica: Look Ross, the only question you need to ask is, "Do you see a future?"
======
I mean like do you see yourself marrying her?
======
Oh my God!
======
You did it already!
======
You married her, didn’t you?!
======
It’s just… Okay, honestly no.
======
I don’t, I don’t see a big future with her.
======
Monica: Okay well I think…that’s your answer.
======
Chandler: Hey, you have to forget about Elizabeth.
======
I mean if you’re not careful you may not get married at all this year!
======
[Scene: The Charity Event, Rachel and Phoebe are sitting at the table as Joey approaches.]
======
Okay, the next highest bidder is at table one.
======
Rachel: Oh great!
======
Joey: (To Phoebe) Oh and uh the guy who got the Paris trip is at table four.
======
Phoebe: Oh, okay.
======
Phoebe: It’s a trip for two!
======
(She gets up and takes off her blouse-type thingy she’s wearing over her dress.)
======
(She walks over to table four.)
======
Phoebe: Oh, en chante.
======
(She holds out her hand for him to kiss it, but he only shakes it.)
======
[Cut to Joey and Rachel approaching table one.]
======
Joey: Uhh, excuse me is there a Mr. Bowmont at this table?
======
Mr. Bowmont: That’s me.
======
Rachel: Oh well, hello.
======
This is your lucky day Mr. Bowmont, the uh gentleman day sailer as just become available again and I believe that you made a bid of $18,000.
======
Joey: You-you have to pay that!
======
It’s not just a guess.
======
Rachel: (To Joey) Okay.
======
Mr. Bowmont: I was actually relieved uh I didn’t win the boat.
======
Rachel: Ohh…

Joey: Are you kidding me?!
======
She’s gonna this boat!
======
Rachel: Y-Yeah!
======
What-what is your wife’s name?
======
Mr. Bowmont: It’s Pam.
======
Oh God okay, just imagine this, "The Pam."
======
Mr. Bowmont: I don’t think she’d like that.
======
Rachel: Okay, uh-uh imagine this, "The Mr.
======
Joey: Oooooh…

Mr. Bowmont: I don’t think so dear.
======
Rachel: Okay look, let me paint you a little picture.
======
(She sits down next to him.)
======
You’ve got the wind in your h—(sees that he’s bald)—arms!
======
You-you get all that peace and quiet that you’ve always wanted!
======
You get back to nature!
======
You can go fishin’!
======
You can—ooh, you can get one of those little hats and have people call you captain, and then when you’re old, Cappy.
======
Mr. Bowmont: What the hell, it’s for a good cause!
======
It’s mine!!
======
Rachel: (To Joey) What?!
======
I-I’ll make payments, whatever it takes, I want the Mr.
======
[Scene: Monica, Chandler, and Phoebe's, Monica is taking out the garbage as Phoebe and Joey enter.
======
Joey: Oh my God, you’re back!
======
Phoebe: Ohh, let me see it!
======
Let me see your hand!
======
Monica: Why do you want to see my hand?
======
Phoebe: I wanna see what’s in your hand.
======
I wanna see the trash.
======
Joey: Yeah.
======
Oh, it’s all dirty.
======
You should throw this out.
======
Monica: (suspiciously) Okay.
======
Chandler: (after the door closes) What did you guys just do?!
======
Phoebe: What happened?
======
Chandler: I’m gonna do it tomorrow y’know, and-and surprise her, but now you’ve ruined it!
======
Chandler: Who walks into a room and asks to see a person’s hands?!
======
Phoebe: Well, a palm reader, a manicurist, a hand doctor…

Joey: Glove salesman!
======
Phoebe: Good one!
======
Yeah.
======
What am I going to do?
======
She doesn’t know for sure, so just throw her off the track.
======
I can make her think marriage is the last thing on my mind.
======
Yeah!
======
Joey: Hey, being you is finally gonna pay off!
======
(They give each other fives.)
======
Oh my God you’re here, let me see your hand!!
======
She already took out the trash!!!
======
[Scene: Outside of Elizabeth’s dormitory, Ross is exiting after breaking up with her and we can hear his thoughts.]
======
She was such a grown-up about it!
======
She didn’t seem too immature for me!
======
I was just thinking about…

Elizabeth: You suck!!
======
Ross: What?!
======
(She throws a water balloon at him and hits him on the head and hits him again at the waist with another one.)
======
Ross: Okay, break-up’s still on!
======
[Scene: Central Perk, Chandler is looking out the window and Joey is sitting on the couch.]
======
Chandler: Okay, okay, here she comes!
======
Do I look like a guy who doesn’t want to get married?
======
Joey: Yeah!
======
And also, a little like a French guy.
======
(They both squint at each other.)
======
Monica: What are you up too?
======
Chandler: Oh, just hanging out, talkin’ about uh, websites.
======
Yeah, we saw this really interesting website about marriage and how totally unnecessary it is and how its just a way for the government to keep tabs on you.
======
Joey: (laughs) Yeah, Big Brother.
======
Monica: Well that’s a little crazy.
======
Although I am y’know glad to hear that you’re branching out on what you look at on the Internet.
======
Chandler: Yeah, well… Y’know, it just got me thinking though, why would anybody ever want to get married huh?
======
To declare your love for one another to the world!
======
Chandler: Eh…

Monica: Okay well that’s good to know.
======
(We hear the backup horn of a truck and see through the window that the Mr. Bowmont has arrived.)
======
Joey: (all excited) The Mr. Bowmont’s here!!!
======
[Scene: Monica’s Restaurant’s kitchen, she’s cooking as a waitress sticks her head in.]
======
Waitress: Hey Monica, there’s a customer who wants to complement the chef, should I let him in?
======
(The customer turns out to be…)

Richard: Hi!
======
Monica: Ohh… Oh, that’s okay I hate when people come back to complement the chef.
======
Richard: Well, it was great seeing you the other night.
======
Monica: Oh, good to see you too.
======
Commercial Break

[Scene: Monica’s Restaurant, continued from earlier.]
======
Monica: What uh—What did you—What?!
======
And I know I probably shouldn’t even be here telling you this, I mean you’re with Chandler a guy I really like, and if you say he’s straight I’ll believe you!
======
After seeing ya the other night I knew if I didn’t tell ya I’d regret it for the rest of my life.
======
Monica: Y’know you’re really not supposed to be back here!
======
Richard: Well yeah, I’m sorry.
======
I know this is the wrong time and the wrong place but I had to tell ya!
======
Monica: Oh God… (Starts looking around.)
======
Richard: I know this is crazy but am I too late?
======
Monica: What the… Yes you’re too late!
======
Richard: Well I know I was an idiot!
======
And I tried to forget you, I really did!
======
Y’know after we had lunch last year I spent six months in Africa trying to get you out of my head!
======
Monica: What were you doing in Africa?
======
Monica: Ohhh!
======
What are you doing to me?!
======
Oh look, I-I… I’m sorry but umm, this-this-this-this is not going to happen.
======
Richard: Okay that’s fine, I’ll walk away.
======
Monica: Well he is!
======
Yeah, I mean marriage is all he talks about!
======
My goodness, in fact, I’m the one that’s making him wait!
======
Richard: You are?
======
Monica: Yeah!
======
[Scene: Central Perk, Rachel is bringing Phoebe some coffee.]
======
Monica and Chandler, gettin’ married.
======
Phoebe: I know, they’re gonna be so happy together.
======
Rachel: Ohh… I mean two best friends falling in love, how often does that happen?
======
Phoebe: Oh no!
======
(They both take a drink of coffee.)
======
I’m like 90/10.
======
Rachel: Yeah me too.
======
(Joey enters looking like Captain Stubing from the Love Boat.)
======
Joey: Hey uh, have you guys scene Chandler?
======
Rachel: (staring at him) Wh—no, but y’know who did stop in here looking for ya, Tennille.
======
[Scene: A Pizza Joint, Chandler and Monica are eating lunch.]
======
In fact, I think the whole concept of marriage is unnatural.
======
Okay pigs don’t mate for life.
======
I mean a pig can have like a hundred sexual partners in a lifetime, and that’s just an ordinary pig not even a pig that’s good at sports!
======
Monica: Yeah, but that’s pigs not people!
======
But do you know what the divorce rate in this country is?
======
Are you honestly telling me that-that you may never want to get married?
======
Chandler: Well, never say never but y’know probably uh yeah, never.
======
Monica: Oh my God!
======
Then-then-then what are we even doing?!
======
What is this?!
======
What is all this pressure?!
======
Why don’t you put down your copy of ‘The Rules’ huh mantrap?!
======
Monica: Y’know what?!
======
(She gets up and storms out.
======
The people at the other tables are staring at Chandler.)
======
Chandler: (to them) It’s okay, I got a plan.
======
[Scene: Central Perk, Phoebe and Rachel are still talking.]
======
Rachel: Yeah, I’m pretty confident about that.
======
It would be nice to have a little guarantee though.
======
Phoebe: What do you mean?
======
Rachel: Well y’know, some people make deals with a friend, like if neither of them are married by the time they’re 40, they marry each other.
======
Phoebe: You mean a backup?
======
Phoebe: Yeah, yeah I got that.
======
Rachel: You do?
======
Phoebe: Yeah, I locked him years ago!
======
Yeah but believe me that is not how he wanted to seal the deal.
======
Rachel: Oh, seriously?
======
Phoebe: Ohh, yeah.
======
I think his exact words were… (She makes two clicking sounds with her tongue and purrs.)
======
Phoebe: Well hey, it’s just a backup.
======
[Scene: Joey and Rachel's, Joey, still looking like Captain Stubing, is practicing his slipknots as Monica enters.]
======
Joey: Hey Monica!
======
Monica: Have you seen Rachel?
======
Monica: Yeah, it’s great.
======
Monica: I’m just having one of those days where you realize you’re in a dead-end relationship!
======
Monica: It’s not like I want to get married tomorrow!
======
It’s just that I-I’d like to believe that I’m in a relationship that’s actually going somewhere, that I’m not just wasting my time!
======
Joey: Well, you know Chandler.
======
Monica: No I don’t know Chandler!
======
It’s like it’s like something’s changed.
======
Monica: What?!
======
Joey: Chandler is a complex fellow, one who is unlikely to take a wife.
======
Monica: What does he think?
======
Does he think I’m just gonna wait around for nothing?
======
Monica: (starts for the door) Well there’s some people who do want to marry me.
======
Joey: There are?
======
Monica: You just told me that he hates marriage!
======
That-that he’s a-a complex fellow who’s unlikely to take a wife!
======
Joey: You got that from what I said?!
======
[Scene: Ross's apartment, Ross is watching a show about the extinction of the dinosaurs.]
======
Narrator: When the Cretaceous period ended, the dinosaurs were gone.
======
Ross: What happened you guys?
======
(There’s a knock on the door, he shuts the TV off, and answers it.)
======
Rachel: Hey you!
======
Ross: Hey, come on in.
======
Rachel: Oh thank you.
======
Hey y’know, I’m so sorry to hear about you and Elizabeth.
======
Ross: Oh, thanks.
======
Yeah, I really thought we’d be able to make it work, but uh, I guess it just wasn’t meant to be.
======
Rachel: Yeah, love.
======
It’s a tricky business isn’t it?
======
If you and I are both single by the time we’re 40, we get married.
======
I mean, we know each other, we like each other, and we’ve-we’ve already slept together so y’know there’ll be no surprises there!
======
You know what I mean?
======
No like, "What’s that?!"
======
Ohh!
======
You-you want me to be your backup.
======
Ross: Ohh, yeah I already have one.
======
Rachel: What?
======
Ross: Ohh, I don’t think so.
======
[Scene: Monica, Chandler, and Phoebe's, Chandler is entering to find Joey, still looking like Captain Stubing, on the phone.]
======
Chandler: I was making a coconut phone with the professor.
======
Yeah, I’ve been trying to find ya to tell to stop messing with her and maybe I would have if these (lifts a leg) damn boat shoes wouldn’t keep flying off!
======
Chandler: My—Oh my God!
======
Joey: I know!
======
They suck!!
======
Chandler: Well what… Y’know what I’m gonna do?
======
Joey: Look, Chandler I don’t think us getting our asses kicked is a solution.
======
Okay?
======
Chandler: You’re right.
======
Chandler: Okay.
======
(Starts running for the bedroom) I’m gonna get the ring!
======
I’m gonna get the ring!
======
(Does so) I’m gonna go find her and (starts running for the door) I’m just going to propose!
======
Chandler: Okay great.
======
Joey: Let me know about that coconut phone, it might great for the boat.
======

Monica: I don’t know.
======
Richard: Oh, okay.
======
Well, I’ll just leave the door open and go sit on the couch.
======
Monica: Yeah, I’ll have a scotch…

Richard: …on the rocks with a twist?
======
Y’know, since we broke up do you ever, think about me?
======
Richard: Oh really?
======
Monica: Yeah but it was because I-I had an eye exam and I don’t like my new eye doctor.
======
Richard: Yeah he’s no good.
======
Do you ever (pause) think about me in a (pause) non-eye doctor way?
======
Monica: But getting over was the hardest thing that I’ve ever had to do.
======
And I never let myself think about you.
======
[Scene: Central Perk, Phoebe is reading as Rachel enters.]
======
You picked Joey and Ross?!
======
You can not have two backups!
======
It’s just good sense to backup your backup!
======
Joey: (entering) Hey!
======
Phoebe: I don’t—Look I don’t know what you’re complaining about now?
======
You were both aware of the situation!
======
Phoebe: Okay, this kind of back talk is not gonna fly when we’re married!
======
You have to pick one!
======
Phoebe: All right well let’s see, Ross is a good father, but Joey has a boat—This is hard!
======
Hey look, I wanna switch to Rachel!
======
(Rachel gets all happy.)
======
Just—Okay—Just wait!
======
You guys!
======
Just remember my promise, when we get married, three times a week.
======
Rachel: Oh God, Phoebe!
======
Rachel: Oh.
======
(She turns her head away and when she’s not looking, Phoebe shakes her head and mouths, "No, I’m not."
======
Rachel: Okay, y’know what?!
======
I know-I know how to settle this!
======
I’m gonna write Joey on one napkin (does so) and I’m gonna right Ross on the other napkin (does so) and we are going to pick one!
======
And that person is going to be our backup!
======
Joey: Okay that’s fair.
======
Rachel: Pick one.
======
Rachel: You’re welcome.
======
Phoebe: Yeah absolutely!
======
(They both switch.)
======
[Scene: Richard’s Apartment, Monica is looking around and notices an African mask hanging on the wall.]
======
Monica: Oh!
======
Y’know, I-I should be with a grown-up, do you know what I mean?!
======
Richard: Yeah!
======
You’re saying, you need to be with someone more mature.
======
Maybe someone with, a license to practice medicine.
======
Monica: Y’know, let’s face it, I’m not a kid anymore!
======
I-I need to be with someone who-who wants the same things that I do!
======
Richard: I think that’s fair.
======
Richard: It’s okay!
======
Hey.
======
(She backs away a little bit but is still in his arms and looks up at his eyes.)
======
I don’t know.
======
Umm…

Richard: I know.
======
Monica: Y’know, I-I… I have to figure…some st—Y’know, some stuff before I can…

Richard: Yeah, I understand.
======
[Scene: Richard’s Apartment, time lapse.
======
Richard: She’s not here and please come in.
======
Richard: Okay, she was here, but she left.
======
Chandler: Well where did she go?
======
Richard: Well she said she had to think things over.
======
Chandler: Oh my God, I can’t believe this!
======
Y’know, I thought…I thought you were a good guy.
======
Richard: Oh, hey look nothing happened.
======
Richard: Well all right, one thing happened?
======
Chandler: Y’know what?
======
Do you know what you did?
======
My girlfriend is out there thinking things over!
======
You made my girlfriend think!!
======
Richard: Well I’m sorry.
======
Chandler: And what does she have to think about?
======
Richard: Well, apparently I’m willing to offer her things that you are not.
======
This was just a plan, y’know?
======
Richard: Well if it helps, it worked very well.
======
Chandler: It was working until you showed up, you big tree!
======
You had your chance with her!
======
You had your chance and you blew it!
======
And this is my chance and I am not going to blow it because we are meant for each other!
======
And this is all just been one stupid mistake!
======
Richard: You were gonna propose?
======
Chandler: Yeah I even (pause) got a ring.
======
Did you get a ring?
======
(Pause) You go get her Chandler.
======
If you do get her, don’t let her go.
======
Chandler: Y’know Richard…you are a good guy.
======
Richard: I know.
======
(Chandler gets up and runs out, but as soon as the door closes behind him he opens it, runs back in, picks up his ring Richard is holding up for him, and runs back out.)
======
[Scene: The Hallway, Chandler is running up the stairs and towards his apartment, but Joey is taking out the garbage at the same time and stops him in the hall.]
======
Joey: She’s gone.
======
Chandler: What?
======
She had a bag and she left.
======
Chandler: What are you talking about?
======
Joey: She was all crying.
======
She-she said you guys want different things, and that and that she needed time to think.
======
Chandler: Well why didn’t you stop her?!
======
Chandler: Well where… Where did she go?
======
Joey: To her parent’s I think and she said you shouldn’t call her.
======
Monica: You wanted it to be a surprise.
======
(He turns to look at Joey who smiles slyly and closes the door leaving them alone.)
======
Chandler: Oh my God.
======
(Monica gets down on one knee.)
======
As to…fall in love with my best…my best… There’s a reason why girls don’t do this!
======
Chandler: Okay!
======
(He joins her on one knee) Okay!
======
Oh God, I thought… (Starting to cry, pauses) Wait a minute, I-I can do this.
======
Then I realized the only thing that matters is that you, (Pause) you make me happier than I ever thought I could be.
======
(Pause as he gets out the ring.)
======
(The crowd goes wild as he puts the ring on her finger.
======
They hug and kiss this time as an engaged couple.)
======
Monica: I knew you were likely to take a wife!
======
(They hug again.)
======
(Everyone screams and has a group hug.)
======
Rachel: Ohhh, this is the least jealous I’ve ever been!
======
Phoebe: Oh no wait no, this is wrong!
======
Monica: Oh…

Rachel: Oh hell, he’s done this three times!
======
He knows what its about!
======
(They all hug again.)
