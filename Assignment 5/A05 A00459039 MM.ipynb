nothing to do once or twice she had peeped into the book her sister was reading but it had no pictures or conversations in it and what is the use of a book thought Alice without pictures of conversation so she was considering in her own mind as well as she could for the hot day made her feel very sleepy and stupid whether the pleasure of making a daisy chain would be worth the trouble of getting up and picking the daisies when suddenly a white rabbit with pink eyes ran close by her there was nothing so very remarkable in that nor did Alice think it's so very much out of the way to hear the rabbit say to itself oh dear oh dear I shall be late when she thought it over afterwards it occurred to her that she ought to have wondered at this but at the time it all seemed quite natural but when the rabbit actually took a watch out of his waistcoat pocket and looked at it and then hurry dot started to her feet for it flashed across her mind that she had never before seen a rabbit with either a waistcoat pocket or a watch to take out of it and burning with curiosity she ran across the field after it and fortunately was just in time to see it pop down a large rabbit hole under the head \n","text 10 :   Alice open the door and found that it led into a small passage not much larger than a rat hole she knelt down and looked along the passage into the loveliest Garden you ever saw how she longed to get out of that dark Hall and wander about among those beds of bright flowers and those cool fountains but she could not even get her head through the doorway and even if my head would go through dot it would be a very little use with that my shoulders oh how I wish I could shut up like a telescope I think I could if I only know how to begin for you see so many out of the way things have happened lately that Alice had begun to think that very few things in deed were really impossible \n","text 11 :   there seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door so she went back to the table half hoping she might find another key on it or at any rate a book of rules for shutting people up like telescopes this time she found a little bottle on it which certainly was not here before said Alice and round the neck of the bottle was a paper label with the words drink me beautifully printed on it in large letters \n","text 16 :   come on there's no use in crying like that said Alice to herself rather sharply I advise you to leave off this minute she generally gave herself very good advice though she very seldom followed it and sometimes she scolded herself so severely as to
