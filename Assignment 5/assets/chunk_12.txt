it was all very well to say drink me but the little wise Alice was not going to do that in a hurry no I'll look first she said and see whether it's marked poison or not for she had read several nice little histories about children who had got burnt and eaten up by wild beasts and other unpleasant things all because they would not remember the simple rules their friends had taught them such as that a red hot poker will burn you if you hold it too long and that if you cut your finger very deeply with a knife it usually bleeds and she had never forgotten that if you drink much from a bottle marked poison it is almost certain to disagree with you sooner or later however this bottle was not marked poison so Alice it and finding it very nice it had in fact a sort of mixed flavor of cherry custard pineapple roast turkey and hot buttered toast she very soon finish it off
